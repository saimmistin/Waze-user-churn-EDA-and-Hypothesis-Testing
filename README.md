Overview

This project focuses on the analysis of user data from the popular navigation app, Waze. We aim to gain insights into user behavior, identify trends, and understand factors affecting user retention.

Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis is a collection of Waze user data, encompassing various features such as user sessions, driving statistics, activity days, device type, and a binary label indicating whether a user has churned or been retained. This dataset offers valuable insights into user engagement with the app.

Data Exploration

The initial phase of the project involved thorough data exploration to understand the dataset's characteristics. This included statistical summaries, histograms, and box plots to visualize the distributions of key features like user sessions, driving days, duration, and more. The insights gained from this exploration laid the foundation for the subsequent analyses.
